# Validation

**Role:** reproducible validation catalog.

The active priority is native X11, namespace admission, and portals. Wayland,
DMA-BUF, XLibre, and legacy-WM commands below remain regression or historical
evidence unless `todo.md` names them as an active exit gate.

Sophia's default validation path must not require native renderer libraries,
kernel devices, a display server, or network access. The default suite protects
the data model, protocol authorities, runtime reducers, renderer admission
records, and deterministic backend seams.
Default physical input validation uses `QueuedInputPoller`. Native libinput
coverage is feature-gated and opt-in; ordinary workspace validation must prove
physical input intake with deterministic queued packets and must not open
`/dev/input` devices.

Run before committing ordinary changes:

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo test --workspace --offline
```

For Sophia X Authority compatibility changes, also run the focused wire suite
and the real-client smoke that exercises the touched path. The
[X11 compatibility matrix](x11-compatibility-matrix.md) identifies each
probe's precise proven surface and next gate; do not treat this list as a full
X server conformance suite:

```sh
cargo test --offline -q -p sophia-protocol
cargo test --offline -q -p sophia-portal
cargo test --offline -q -p sophia-x-authority --test x11_wire

```

Milestone 5 uses one unattended local QEMU acceptance command. It boots a
diskless, networkless Linux guest that owns virtio DRM/KMS, guest console state,
libinput keyboard and pointer devices, and the Sophia session:

```sh
tools/qemu_milestone5_acceptance.sh
```

The runner rebuilds the initramfs, runs the strict two-xterm native-session
regression, exercises Ctrl-Alt-Backspace emergency recovery, then runs classic
shared-X and confined GTK3 Zenity profiles. The GTK profiles require exact
virtio `sophia` text, a routed pointer button before Return is accepted,
CPU/SHM pixels changed by a committed resize, native presentation on both
guest outputs, normal application exit, zero protocol errors, and clean
retirement. Evidence is retained below `.evidence/qemu-milestone5/`.

`tools/live_session_milestone5_gtk_hardware_proof.sh` remains an optional
compatibility diagnostic for any machine where direct DRM/KMS, VT, and physical
input behavior needs investigation. It is not a milestone gate. Its independent
input guard, bounded process-group termination, and KD/termios restoration remain
fail-closed safeguards for direct hardware use.

The fixture-backed GTK and TTY recovery verifier check remains available through
`tools/check_live_session_milestone5_verifier.sh`.

The real-client smokes are regression smokes, not full X server conformance
tests. Their reduced output must keep `first_error=none`, report the
proof-window outcome explicitly, and include request/opcode counters so future
client-driven regressions show which compatibility surface changed. The
external probe harness fails if it observes any client-visible X protocol
error, even after a drawing client has already produced authority transactions.
External probe binaries are resolved from `PATH`; set
`SOPHIA_XAUTHORITY_<LABEL>` to override a probe binary path for a local host.
`x-authority-xterm-smoke` is a setup/lifecycle regression, not a rendered
transaction proof; its reduced output is expected to report zero committed
runtime transactions. `x-authority-xterm-render-smoke` is the separate drawing
transaction and materialized CPU-pixel proof. The guarded session tools are the
separate Engine/KMS evidence.
`x-authority-zenity-smoke` is a GTK software-rendering regression. Prefer
running it under `dbus-run-session --` on TTY hosts so GTK reaches its DBus
startup path. It requires a committed surface, a copied nonzero `MIT-SHM`
buffer, and `first_error=none`. Pixel requirements are declarative probe policy;
the frontend does not branch on client names.
Parse-error details include a bounded request head so extension decode failures
show the concrete minor opcode that drove the next compatibility slice.

For live composition changes that connect X Authority transaction intake to
backend-live rendered scanout reporting, run the commands below. These validate
the backend-owned production runtime as well as the Engine, renderer, and
backend boundaries:

```sh
cargo test --offline -q -p sophia-backend-live --features libdrm-events live_session_composition
cargo run --offline -q -p sophia-cli --features atomic-scanout-live -- live-session-composition-smoke

tools/audit_no_xlibre_runtime.sh
# Dedicated text TTY with SOPHIA_INPUT_DEVICES set:
tools/wayland_kitty_hardware_proof.sh
```

The Milestone 4 proof must pass both the software verifier and the strict
schema-14 GPU verifier. A DMA-BUF-only mixed-export diagnostic does not satisfy
the gate: the retained GPU run must include the CPU background layer, positive
acquire waiting, rejection recovery, Flip/Idle and idle-fence activity, and
zero live resources. On an AMDGPU command-stream rejection, capture
`sudo dmesg -T` immediately before another graphical session obscures the
kernel validator record.

Before repeating the full paired proof, run
`tools/native_egl_vkcube_mixed_smoke.sh` from the same dedicated text TTY. It
uses the real native-X `vkcube` DRI3 handoff, executes the CPU-plus-DMA-BUF
native EGL export in a watchdog child, stops before KMS submit, and verifies a
single `sophia_native_egl_mixed schema=1` line with positive CPU and DMA-BUF
layers plus zero live presentation resources. The full proof preauthorizes
`sudo` and retains `kernel-before.log`, `kernel-after.log`, and environment
identity beside the software and GPU session logs.

The retained two-xterm hardware proof must preserve its 2,000 ms startup,
25 ms maximum-composition, 100 ms input-to-presentation, complete event-flush,
two-layer, and clean-teardown gates. Its current retained result is 1,487 ms,
10 ms, 23 ms, all 14 events flushed, and no cleanup debt. It remains
`hardware`, not `session`, evidence until the compatibility-matrix promotion
gate passes.

## Wayland And DMA-BUF Maintenance Evidence

The native Wayland Kitty smoke is non-destructive: it uses a private Wayland
socket, software rendering, and the headless CPU composition path. It also
requests a 1024x640 resize from the initial 1280x720 configure and requires
Kitty to keep the old frame live until ack before committing changing nonzero
pixels at the new size. The runtime
audit proves the production CLI dependency graph and installed launcher do not
select or start XLibre/Xorg. Historical XLibre latency and fallback artifacts
are frozen under `research/xlibre` and are not release gates.

The native session defaults to its proven SHM path even with `--native-scanout`.
The bounded DMA-BUF path requires the explicit experimental
`--experimental-dmabuf` flag. Controlled output-sized direct scanout has passing
hardware evidence; arbitrary window-sized client GPU composition does not. Run
the controlled external producer from a dedicated text TTY with an outside
recovery path:

```bash
# First-frame admission and retirement:
SOPHIA_DMABUF_PRODUCER_FRAMES=3 tools/wayland_dmabuf_first_frame_hardware_proof.sh

# Reuse/lifetime stress after the first frame passes:
SOPHIA_DMABUF_PRODUCER_FRAMES=300 tools/wayland_dmabuf_first_frame_hardware_proof.sh
```

The proof requires explicit experimental enablement, at least one DMA-BUF
import, multiple KMS submissions, accepted callbacks and retirement, no import
loss, submit/retire/callback failures, in-flight ownership, or cleanup debt,
and a maximum submit-to-page-flip interval no greater than 100 ms.

Current hardware status: after explicitly detaching the EGLImage from its GL
texture before destruction, the GDB-backed controlled three-frame run passes.
It imports, submits, page-flips, retires, and releases three full-size 1920x1200
DMA-BUF frames with no allocator diagnostic and a 14 ms maximum
submit-to-page-flip interval. The GDB-backed 300-frame lifetime diagnostic also
passes: 300 imports, submissions, page flips, and retirements, with no cleanup
debt and the same 14 ms maximum submit-to-page-flip interval. The release-timing
trace and four later normal release runs also passed. These samples do not clear
the gate: a later normal 300-frame run aborted after frame 2 with `free():
invalid pointer`. Each imported EGLImage now uses a transient GL texture,
released before its EGLImage is destroyed. The repaired three-frame proof then
passed at 16 ms, and a core-mode run plus three separate normal 300-frame runs
passed at 14–16 ms with zero cleanup debt. The controlled gate is satisfied,
but those normal runs remain the required regression check before any future
promotion retry.

On Void Linux, use the release-timing trace after a future controlled failure:

```bash
tools/run_void_dmabuf_lifetime_proof.sh --trace
```

It retains release scheduling and records ordered renderer, KMS, page-flip,
retirement, and client-release stages in
`~/.local/state/sophia/dmabuf-promotion/controlled-lifecycle-trace.log`. Use
`tools/run_void_dmabuf_lifetime_proof.sh --diagnostic` for the GDB comparison.

If an uninstrumented run aborts with allocator output, preserve its normal-run
core (limited to 128 MiB) without starting under GDB:

```bash
tools/run_void_dmabuf_lifetime_proof.sh --core
```

On failure it keeps the log and core at
`~/.local/state/sophia/dmabuf-promotion/controlled-lifecycle-core.log` and its
`.core` sibling for offline stack inspection.

After a future normal 300-frame failure, require three independent
uninstrumented passes before clearing the lifecycle gate. This preserves each
evidence file instead of overwriting it:

```bash
tools/run_void_dmabuf_lifetime_proof.sh --runs 3
```

To capture the native allocator stack from a dedicated text TTY, install `gdb`
if needed and rerun the controlled three-frame proof in diagnostic mode:

```bash
tools/diagnose_void_dmabuf_heap.sh
```

The normal evidence file and a sibling `.gdb.log` retain the process stack and
ordered DMA-BUF stages. Diagnostic mode is only for the controlled proof; do
not use it for the interactive Kitty gate. To diagnose a lifetime failure, set
`SOPHIA_DMABUF_DIAGNOSTIC_FRAMES=300` before running the same helper.

For the real-Kitty gate, set `SOPHIA_INPUT_DEVICES` to comma-separated keyboard
and pointer event paths. The guarded launcher asks for its recovery chord before
DRM takeover. In Kitty, type `sophia` plus Enter, press all four arrow keys,
move/click the pointer, then type `exit` plus Enter. With the controlled
300-frame proof passed, run:

```bash
tools/wayland_kitty_dmabuf_promotion_gate.sh
```

It first proves the direct, output-sized DMA-BUF producer, then requires exactly
three independent Kitty logs. Every Kitty log must show all eleven evdev
keycodes, routed pointer input, presented-input latency no greater than 100 ms,
normal client completion, restored KD mode, termios state and `keyd`, and no
surviving session or input-guard process. Kitty intentionally remains on SHM:
the current DMA-BUF route is direct scanout and cannot present its arbitrary
window-sized buffers. Re-enable DMA-BUF for Kitty only after GPU composition
can import, scale, and blend into Sophia's output-sized scanout target.
`tools/finish_wayland_kitty_milestones.sh` is the operator entry point: it
discovers the stable keyboard and pointer aliases, runs the three-frame and
300-frame controlled proofs, and then runs those three guarded Kitty proofs.
Use `--dry-run` from any shell to inspect discovery without opening input or DRM
devices.

On Void Linux, `tools/setup_void_dmabuf_promotion.sh` installs the required
development packages and then starts that operator entry point. Use
`--dry-run` to install dependencies and inspect device discovery only, or
`--skip-install` when the packages are already present. Its installer transcript
is retained at `~/.local/state/sophia/void-dmabuf-install.log`.

The archived XLibre latency smoke used a dummy XLibre display,
routes synthetic text over the compatibility XTEST connection, and requires a
damage patch plus presented pixel latency of at most 100 milliseconds. The
Kitty variant uses software GL, reusable MIT-SHM readback, and a fixed 1280x720
window; it requires each readback to remain within the 1280x720 XRGB budget.
The fallback smoke disables MIT-SHM and proves that degraded XGetImage capture
keeps the session operational while the interactive verifier rejects it. The
guarded physical Kitty proof must meet the same latency limit without a
libinput processing-lag warning and must drain native scanout cleanly. Its
schema 9 component gates require CPU composition at or below 25 milliseconds,
MIT-SHM capture at or below 30 milliseconds, native upload at or below 50
milliseconds, and submit-to-page-flip at or below 100 milliseconds. One native
target and one GL pipeline must be created per output, with no size-triggered
recreation during a fixed-size proof. The QEMU gate uses a 100-millisecond
upload ceiling because its renderer is software-emulated, while retaining the
same 100-millisecond presented-input and page-flip limits.

The emergency-recovery QEMU scenario starts the independent input guard, sends
one complete Ctrl-Alt-Backspace chord to arm it, waits for the live virtual
libinput path and committed focus, then sends a second chord. It requires both
the guard trigger and an `emergency_exit`, followed by bounded live-session and
native-scanout cleanup. It is the non-destructive prerequisite for the
installed-session recovery test. QEMU does not exercise the host VT or DRM
device, so it cannot replace the final guarded hardware restoration gate.

The installed Kitty session has an additional destructive TTY gate. Run it
only with SSH or another outside control plane available. The first
Ctrl-Alt-Backspace must arm the independent input guard before graphics
takeover; normal typing must then change Kitty pixels. For the recovery half,
stop the Sophia session process from the outside control plane, press
Ctrl-Alt-Backspace again, and require return to the text TTY within five
seconds with `keyd` restored and no surviving Sophia/Kitty process or DRM
ownership. Inspect the persistent latest logs for every input-pipeline stage.

`live-session-composition-smoke` is non-destructive. Its reduced output must
report `status=Passed`, one or more drained authority batches, committed runtime
transactions, applied runtime surfaces, and
`rendered_scanout_submit=SubmittedWaitingForPageFlip`,
`rendered_scanout_retire=RetiredAfterPageFlip`,
`runtime_scanout_state=Retired`, and `cleanup_pending=false`.

Use `tools/qemu_session_harness.sh` for repeated native GBM/KMS development.
The harness waits for the guest's physical-input readiness marker, types
`sophia` through QMP and virtio-keyboard, and requires all press/release events
to pass through libinput and Engine focus before changed xterm pixels count as
input proof. QMP also performs a bounded virtio-mouse double-click selection,
and the verifier requires nonzero routed pointer events plus a second xterm
pixel change. The guest requires two connected virtual KMS outputs. Engine
discovers both, owns both connector/CRTC/primary-plane chains, and presents an
extended horizontal desktop. The verifier requires per-output nonzero
submissions, callbacks, retirements, exports, distinct checksums, and a
page-flip-paced vsync record with zero overlap or phase rejection.
It boots an isolated direct-kernel initramfs with virtio-gpu and verifies
exactly 300 session ticks without host DRM, input-device, VT, disk, or guest
network access. The QEMU evidence verifier also rejects native submit/retire
failure, rejected callbacks, in-flight ownership, cleanup debt, and a tick
count other than 300. QEMU does not claim VRR because virtio-gpu does not expose
the physical property contract. Keep the physical TTY proof for the AMD
multi-connector/VRR gates and operator-typed input evidence.

### X11 Live-Session Stability Diagnostics

After an allocator abort or a flushed-input pixel timeout, do not repeatedly run
the combined milestone gate. From a dedicated local text TTY with no graphical
compositor, first run the automated synthetic-input stability workload:

```sh
tools/run_x11_live_session_stability.sh --runs 10
```

The workload uses the same persistent X11 CPU-upload and Engine-owned KMS path
without requiring operator typing. It retains independent logs under
`~/.local/state/sophia/x11-live-session-stability/`. To capture the native
allocator seam, use exactly one diagnostic mode:

```sh
tools/run_x11_live_session_stability.sh --diagnostic
tools/run_x11_live_session_stability.sh --trace
tools/run_x11_live_session_stability.sh --core
```

GDB follows the Sophia parent and detaches from xterm, builds the release binary
with full Rust debuginfo, enables glibc and Mesa diagnostics, and records all
thread stacks. Core mode caps the dump at 128 MiB. Trace mode records reduced
EGL/GBM lifecycle stages without native handles. A fix is not hardware-stable
until ten automated runs report exact terminal text plus changed pixels, three
physical keyboard/pixel runs do the same, and the complete milestone helper
passes without allocator output, stale generations, missing pixels, callback
rejection, in-flight ownership, or cleanup debt.

The two remaining physical gates are deliberately separate from the QEMU
regression loop. On a dedicated TTY, after the graphical compositor has
released DRM master, run:

```sh
tools/finish_milestones_1_2.sh
```

The historical combined helper auto-selects the keyboard when exactly one stable
keyboard path exists and executes the retained physical diagnostics. It
refuses to proceed while River, Niri, Sway, Hyprland, KWin, or Xorg is active,
so invoking it accidentally from the live graphical session cannot take DRM
master. Set `SOPHIA_OPERATOR_KEYBOARD` only when more than one keyboard path is
listed. When `keyd` is active, the interactive helper uses `sudo sv down keyd`
before opening the physical keyboard and an EXIT trap restores it with
`sudo sv up keyd` after success, failure, or interruption. There is no separate
confirmation prompt whose Return could enter the exact input proof.

The normal supervised operator path is:

```sh
tools/run_sophia_session.sh --wm=xmonad
```

It starts the generic bridge as `sophia-live-session`'s supervised WM process,
uses xmonad only as the selected bridge client, and launches approved applications
from the bounded normal-session registry. `--wm=native` selects the Sophia WM API
demo and `--wm=none` runs without an external policy process. The unattended
`tools/qemu_xmonad_m8_launcher_acceptance.sh` gate proves startup, xmonad-driven
terminal launch and close, logout, bridge restart recovery, and clean two-output
shutdown. The frozen Milestone 7 regression remains
`tools/qemu_xmonad_m7_acceptance.sh`.

Milestone 8 adds two explicit application scenarios:

```sh
cargo run --offline -q -p sophia-cli -- x-authority-firefox-smoke
tools/qemu_xmonad_m8_mix_acceptance.sh
tools/qemu_xmonad_m8_soak_acceptance.sh
```

The M8 image profile is isolated, offline, and storage-free. It requires
Firefox, `vkcube`, and Mesa Lavapipe; set `SOPHIA_FIREFOX_BIN`,
`SOPHIA_VKCUBE_BIN`, or `SOPHIA_LVP_ICD` when they are not installed in the
standard Void paths. The mix verifier requires four managed application IDs,
two independently retired outputs, workspace and bridge-recovery evidence,
zero normal-session protocol errors, and final frontend/application cleanup.
The soak reuses that scenario for at least 1,800,000 ms and twenty complete
interaction cycles. Application launch and close steps are evidence-driven:
the harness waits for the matching managed-process start or exit record before
advancing, so a slow Firefox startup cannot be hidden by fixed sleeps.

The older bounded proof wrapper can pass `--max-runtime-ms=10000`,
`--inject-text=sophia`, and `--exit-after-input-proof`; passing evidence requires one
WM request, one acknowledged resize, one committed layout with a moved surface,
the proof shell to receive exactly `sophia`, and a later terminal pixel change.
Schema-11 live evidence records `input_text_match=true`; changed pixels without
the semantic completion record fail verification. The separate xterm raster
smoke also requires an exact readable ASCII glyph match. The final physical gate uses the wrapper
without injection and requires operator-visible typing on the scanned-out xterm.

The keyboard helper presents `type sophia then Return:` inside the scanned-out
xterm and waits up to 15 seconds for that exact press/release sequence. A fresh
five-second pixel deadline begins only after Return is released. The proof fails
on an unexpected key, modifier, repeat, missing release, missing Return, or if
later xterm pixels do not change. Accepted evidence records all 14 expected and
matched events after Engine focus routing and core-X translation. The VRR helper
is destructive and requires a connector reporting `vrr_capable=1` plus
the selected CRTC's `VRR_ENABLED` property. It submits an Engine-eligible
opaque fullscreen modeset with `VRR_ENABLED=true`, waits for presentation, then
submits an overlay/ineligible fixed-refresh fallback with `VRR_ENABLED=false`
and waits for its page flip and retirement. Both reduced phase lines and the
underlying atomic scanout lines must pass their strict verifiers.

Use `atomic-vrr-inspect` for a non-destructive reduced view of the selected
connector/CRTC IDs, discovery status, capability value, enable-property
presence, and bounded property-name lists. A connector reporting
`vrr_capable=0` is valid unsupported hardware and cannot satisfy the activation
gate even when its CRTC exposes `VRR_ENABLED`.

The optional renderer-native features have extra local checks:

```sh
cargo test --offline -p sophia-renderer-live --features gbm-probe
cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features gbm-probe
cargo test --offline -p sophia-renderer-live --features egl-probe
cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features egl-probe
cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features gbm-probe,egl-probe
cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features libdrm-events
cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features libinput-events
cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features libdrm-events,libinput-events
```

The `gbm-probe` feature admits the safe `gbm` crate behind an optional feature.
It exercises fake and native GBM capability records while keeping the public
boundary reduced to capability health. This command must remain optional, and
the default workspace suite must continue to pass without native renderer
feature flags.

The `egl-probe` feature admits `khronos-egl` through the internal
`sophia-renderer-native-egl` adapter crate. That crate owns the unavoidable
unsafe dynamic EGL calls. Public renderer-live and backend-live tests assert
only reduced EGL startup and draw-smoke status.

The `libdrm-events` feature admits Smithay's `drm` crate as an optional
backend-live dependency. It checks only the reduced dependency-admission report,
private native adapter skeleton, page-flip event polling adapter shape, and
deterministic fake poller that feeds the runtime-owned bounded callback queue.
Native page-flip values must be reduced before they reach runtime observation.
The native-shaped reader contract is still deterministic: tests feed reduced
native callback facts through a bounded reader before the poller decodes them
through backend-local output routes.
Real libdrm event validation is gated by
`SOPHIA_RUN_REAL_LIBDRM_EVENTS_SMOKE=1`. Without that variable, future hardware
smokes must return a reduced skipped report and avoid opening DRM device nodes.
Until a concrete native page-flip reader exists, the reduced smoke report fails
closed as `BackendUnavailable` when this gate is requested.

The `libinput-events` feature admits the safe Rust `input` wrapper as the
concrete libinput dependency. It defines the reduced live input event reader and
poller shape, proves that the poller implements Sophia Engine's non-blocking
input contract, and smoke-tests an empty path-based libinput context without
opening devices. The reader reduces pointer motion, pointer button, and
keyboard key events through a reduced seat/device map without changing runtime
reports.
Real libinput validation is gated by
`SOPHIA_RUN_REAL_LIBINPUT_EVENTS_SMOKE=1`. Without that variable, future
hardware smokes must return a reduced skipped report and avoid opening input
devices or reporting device paths, seat names, file descriptors, or libinput
error strings. Until device-opening hardware smoke is admitted, the reduced
smoke report fails closed as `BackendUnavailable` when this gate is requested.

The backend-live GBM feature suite includes an opt-in real-device smoke. Set
`SOPHIA_RUN_REAL_GBM_SMOKE=1` to let the test look for an openable
`/dev/dri/renderD*` node, route that backend-owned fd-like authority through the
GBM probe, and assert only reduced startup status. Without that environment
variable, the smoke returns early. This keeps CI deterministic and avoids
letting native driver crashes fail ordinary validation.

The combined `gbm-probe,egl-probe` backend suite uses the same environment gate
for the GBM-backed EGL path. When `SOPHIA_RUN_REAL_GBM_SMOKE=1` is set and an
openable render node exists, the test requires the private GBM/EGL draw smoke to
reach `ClearColorReady` and the offscreen presentation smoke to reach `Ready`.
It still exposes no render-node path, fd, GBM object, EGL object, pixel, driver
error, or KMS identity through Sophia's public reports. The real GBM/EGL smoke
runs the native path in a child test process so a driver crash reports as an
opt-in validation failure instead of terminating ordinary deterministic tests.

The combined `libdrm-events,gbm-probe` backend suite also includes an opt-in
atomic scanout smoke. Run `tools/atomic_scanout_preflight.sh` first when the
host state is unknown. That preflight drives the feature-gated
`sophia atomic-scanout-preflight` CLI command instead of a test filter. It does
not request DRM master, does not modeset hardware, and emits exactly one reduced
`sophia_atomic_scanout_preflight` line: schema version, validation target,
readiness status, capped primary card count, capped read/write-openable primary
card count, capped atomic-capability-admitted primary card count, capped KMS
scanout-target primary card count, and capped atomic-property-ready primary card
count. It does not expose device paths, file descriptors, native errors,
permissions, or KMS object identity. The helper verifies the captured log before
exiting and fails unless the host is smoke-ready. Use
`tools/verify_atomic_scanout_preflight.sh` directly when you need to check an
existing capture; the verifier requires
`CandidatePrimaryCardsAtomicReady` and at least one primary card node that
admits the `UniversalPlanes` and `Atomic` DRM client capabilities, exposes a
reduced KMS connector/CRTC/primary-plane target, and has the atomic property
handles needed for the primary-plane request. Under `libdrm-events`, preflight
and `select_real_atomic_scanout_card` use the same reduced readiness probe, so
the non-modesetting gate and the destructive selector do not drift.
Real card-selection and page-flip-session setup failures reduce themselves into
`LibdrmNativeAtomicScanoutSmokeEvidence`, so setup evidence stays consistent
outside the smoke harness as well.

The real DRM-master hardware proof needs a machine and login session with these
properties:

- Rust 1.96 or newer is active. Rustup users should pick up
  `rust-toolchain.toml`; distro-package users must install an equivalent
  compiler before running the proof scripts.
- Linux exposes at least one primary `/dev/dri/card*` node and the active
  kernel driver supports atomic KMS.
- At least one display connector is physically connected and has a usable mode.
- The operator has read/write access to the selected primary card node.
- The run can become DRM master. In practice, this usually means using a local
  TTY or a dedicated test session after stopping the active display manager or
  compositor.
- Modeset disruption is acceptable. The destructive smoke is allowed to change
  scanout state while it proves initial modeset and steady page-flip behavior.
- The machine can build the feature-gated backend-live CLI commands offline
  from the checked-out dependency set.

Run `tools/atomic_scanout_smoke.sh` only from a session that may take DRM master
on a primary `/dev/dri/card*` node. The helper verifies preflight first, then
runs the feature-gated `sophia atomic-scanout-smoke` CLI command with
`SOPHIA_RUN_REAL_ATOMIC_SCANOUT_SMOKE=1`. The CLI parent spawns a child process
for the destructive proof and emits reduced `SmokeChildTimeout` evidence if the
child fails to produce page-flip evidence within the bounded deadline. The
helper forwards optional CLI targeting arguments: `--slot`, `--output`,
`--authority`, `--page-flip-timeout-ms`, and `--child-timeout-ms`. The page-flip
timeout bounds native callback waiting inside the smoke child; the child timeout
bounds the parent watchdog around the destructive child process and defaults to
30 seconds. The native page-flip wait defaults to 8 seconds.
Backend-live first uses the production `select_real_atomic_scanout_card` seam to
choose an opaque card owner that opens read/write, admits UniversalPlanes and
Atomic client capabilities, exposes a reduced KMS primary-plane scanout target,
and has the atomic property handles needed for primary-plane commit. The
selected card is then promoted into a page-flip session owner that keeps the
submit card, cloned event reader, and routed poller together. With
`libinput-events` enabled, that same owner can drive one backend runtime tick
through the native GBM rendered-primary-plane scanout path and native page-flip
poller, so callers do not have to split fd ownership apart. That same page-flip
session owner also owns the destructive hardware proof phases. The smoke child
creates a persistent backend-live GBM/EGL rendered-scanout exporter, then asks
the session to run `InitialModeset` and `SteadyPageFlip` proof phases. The
session clears a GBM surface, locks the rendered front buffer through the normal
runtime export seam, submits a primary-plane atomic modeset, waits for reduced
page-flip evidence, and retires the submitted framebuffer resources. It then
exports a second rendered front buffer and submits it through the steady-state
page-flip policy, proving the post-modeset path without `ALLOW_MODESET`. Each
submitted phase waits within a bounded deadline for native page-flip evidence
before reducing the final smoke record.
The real card fd is opened nonblocking, so missing callbacks reduce as missing
evidence instead of hanging inside the DRM event read.
Without verified preflight and that environment variable, the destructive path
never opens or modesets hardware.
The stable evidence shape for that run is the
`sophia_atomic_scanout_evidence` line pair: schema version, phase, overall
status, rendered context status, GBM export status, primary-plane property
discovery status, scanout-buffer import status, reduced GBM export detail,
reduced scanout-buffer format, modifier, and plane-count shape, native resource
creation status, atomic request build status, primary-plane submit status,
reduced request scope, page-flip poll status, reduced commit flags, reduced
page-flip wait outcome, page-flip event status, retirement status, retire-time
resource destroy status, and retire-time cleanup-pending status only. A passing
capture must contain both `InitialModeset` and
`SteadyPageFlip`, and both phases must report `page_flip_wait=Retired`. Failed
captures
reduce the stop point without native identity: smoke-child timeout, primary-card
open, DRM client capability setup, KMS target selection, rendered-context
creation, GBM export stage, retained-resource ownership, scanout-buffer import,
property discovery, resource creation, request build, atomic submit,
request-shape mismatch, page-flip reader setup, page-flip delivery,
page-flip wait state, waiting-retire state, and resource retirement are reported
separately.
Runtime rendered-primary-plane submits can also be captured as reduced
`sophia_runtime_rendered_scanout_submit` lines. Those lines are not a substitute
for the two-phase hardware smoke evidence, but they are useful when inspecting a
running production loop: schema 6 includes the reduced submit status, scanout
target, reduced output size, frame target, reduced frame-target size, GBM export,
scanout-buffer validation, reduced scanout-buffer format, modifier, and
plane-count shape, reduced plane format-table presence, native submit stages,
framebuffer-creation detail, atomic commit flags, commit submit result, runtime
scanout state, and in-flight age, plus whether native cleanup debt is pending,
without exposing DRM object IDs, file descriptors, GEM handles, pitch/offset
arrays, exact modifier values, property blob IDs, or native driver errors.
Runtime retirement and cleanup retries can be captured as
`sophia_runtime_rendered_scanout_retire` and
`sophia_runtime_rendered_scanout_cleanup` lines. They record reduced retirement
status, destroy status, runtime scanout state, in-flight age, and cleanup debt,
so a live loop can distinguish clean retirement, stale callback waits, and
cleanup retry failures.
If the runtime proof producer cannot reach a submit-to-retire observation, it
emits `sophia_runtime_rendered_scanout_failure` with a reduced reason such as
`InitialTickFailed`, `SubmitReportMissing`, `RetireTickFailed`, or
`RetireTimedOut`. Failure lines are useful diagnostics, but they are never valid
clean proof evidence.
Use `tools/verify_runtime_rendered_scanout_evidence.sh` for a narrow clean
runtime proof. It expects exactly one submitted rendered-primary-plane scanout
line and exactly one clean retired line, rejects cleanup retry and failure
lines, and rejects unknown, duplicate, or malformed fields. This verifier proves a
single-frame runtime submit-to-retire observation; the destructive two-phase
hardware proof still comes from `tools/verify_atomic_scanout_evidence.sh`.
To capture that runtime proof on real hardware, run
`tools/runtime_rendered_scanout_evidence.sh` from a session where DRM master and
modeset disruption are acceptable. The helper runs atomic preflight, executes
the feature-gated `sophia atomic-scanout-runtime-evidence` command with
`SOPHIA_RUN_REAL_ATOMIC_SCANOUT_SMOKE=1`, captures the reduced runtime evidence
log, and verifies it with `tools/verify_runtime_rendered_scanout_evidence.sh`.
The stable evidence shape for the GBM/EGL renderer smoke is
`LiveRealGbmSmokeEvidence`: status, draw status, presentation status, and
frame-target allocation status only.

When touching renderer-native code, run both paths:

```sh
cargo test --workspace --offline
cargo test --offline -p sophia-renderer-live --features gbm-probe
cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features gbm-probe
cargo test --offline -p sophia-renderer-live --features egl-probe
cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features egl-probe
cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features gbm-probe,egl-probe
cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features libdrm-events
cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features libinput-events
cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features libdrm-events,libinput-events
```

For the current atomic scanout backend work, the local non-hardware gate is:

```sh
tools/check_atomic_scanout_local.sh
```

It runs formatting, the GBM/EGL renderer checks, the backend-live
libdrm/libinput scanout feature checks, and the reduced verifier fixture
checks. It does not request DRM master or modeset hardware.

Run the opt-in local hardware smoke only when you want real render-node
coverage:

```sh
SOPHIA_RUN_REAL_GBM_SMOKE=1 cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features gbm-probe,egl-probe
```

The libdrm and libinput real-hardware gates are defined before their concrete
native readers are admitted:

```sh
SOPHIA_RUN_REAL_LIBDRM_EVENTS_SMOKE=1 cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features libdrm-events
SOPHIA_RUN_REAL_LIBINPUT_EVENTS_SMOKE=1 cargo test --offline -p sophia-backend-live --features libinput-events
```

Until those readers exist, these variables only document the future opt-in
shape. The deterministic feature tests must continue to pass without them.

Run the atomic scanout hardware smoke only from a local session where modeset
and DRM master disruption are acceptable. The helper captures the reduced
preflight log, verifies host readiness, captures the reduced evidence log, and
runs only the opt-in atomic scanout CLI smoke:

```sh
tools/atomic_scanout_smoke.sh
SOPHIA_ATOMIC_SCANOUT_EVIDENCE=/tmp/sophia-atomic-smoke.log tools/atomic_scanout_smoke.sh
tools/atomic_scanout_smoke.sh --slot=1 --output=1 --authority=1 --page-flip-timeout-ms=8000 --child-timeout-ms=30000
```

The helper runs the verified preflight before the smoke and
`tools/verify_atomic_scanout_evidence.sh` after a successful smoke. Set
`SOPHIA_ATOMIC_SCANOUT_SKIP_PREFLIGHT=1` only when preflight is known to be
wrong for the host and a modesetting smoke is still intentional.

For the full hardware proof, prefer `tools/atomic_scanout_hardware_proof.sh`.
It runs preflight once, captures the destructive two-phase atomic evidence,
captures the runtime rendered-scanout submit-to-retire evidence, and verifies
all three reduced logs:

```sh
tools/atomic_scanout_hardware_proof.sh --slot=1 --output=1 --authority=1 --page-flip-timeout-ms=8000 --child-timeout-ms=30000
```

To verify captured logs without rerunning hardware:

```sh
tools/verify_atomic_scanout_evidence.sh /tmp/sophia-atomic-smoke.log
tools/verify_atomic_scanout_preflight.sh /tmp/sophia-atomic-scanout-preflight.log
tools/verify_runtime_rendered_scanout_evidence.sh /tmp/sophia-runtime-rendered-scanout.log
```

To inspect the default hardware-proof logs and local device visibility in one
place, use:

```sh
tools/atomic_scanout_hardware_status.sh
```

This helper does not request DRM master and does not modeset hardware. It may
print local diagnostic facts such as toolchain availability and `/dev/dri` node
counts, so its output is for the operator. The reduced proof artifacts remain
the three verifier-accepted logs.

The verifier accepts only reduced evidence that proves a rendered GBM
front-buffer export, primary-plane property discovery, native resource
creation, atomic request build, primary-plane atomic submit, nonblocking
page-flip commit flags, native page-flip delivery, and explicit resource
retirement for both the initial modeset and steady-state page-flip phases. It
also requires the current evidence schema and rejects duplicate or unknown
fields, so a passing capture cannot smuggle native object identity into the
reduced log. A clean capture may report any reduced created-framebuffer path:
no-modifier AddFB2, modifier-aware AddFB2, or legacy AddFB fallback.

The verifier fixtures can be checked without hardware:

```sh
tools/check_atomic_scanout_verifiers.sh
```

That script proves the preflight verifier accepts only an atomic-ready reduced
host record, rejects impossible count relationships, and rejects native host
identity fields. It also proves the scanout evidence verifier rejects missing
steady-state page-flip evidence, the wrong steady-state request scope, and
native identity fields.

## Retiring `DEFAULT_DISPLAY`

The `DEFAULT_DISPLAY` EGL smoke is temporary, but it is not removable merely
because the GBM-backed path exists. It can be retired only after the opt-in real
render-node validation is repeatably green and the reduced public boundary is
unchanged.

Current decision: keep `DEFAULT_DISPLAY` for now as a host compatibility smoke.
The real GBM/EGL path has passed repeated local validation on the current
machine, but one host is not enough evidence to remove a broad compatibility
check. `DEFAULT_DISPLAY` remains non-production-shaped; it must not be used as
the compositor platform boundary.

Before removing it, record evidence that:

- `SOPHIA_RUN_REAL_GBM_SMOKE=1` passes after a clean build;
- the same command passes in repeated local runs on the target development
  machine;
- the GBM-backed draw smoke reaches `ClearColorReady`;
- the offscreen presentation smoke reaches `Ready`;
- the reduced frame-target allocation smoke reaches `Ready`;
- `LiveRealGbmSmokeEvidence` records `Passed` without exposing native identity;
- driver crashes remain isolated to child-process validation failures;
- no public report exposes render-node paths, file descriptors, GBM/EGL objects,
  native errors, pixels, KMS framebuffer IDs, connector IDs, CRTC IDs, or plane
  IDs.

If any condition fails, keep `DEFAULT_DISPLAY` as a host compatibility smoke and
continue treating GBM-backed EGL as the production-shaped path under
development.

Minimum host/device matrix before retirement:

- one Intel integrated GPU machine;
- one AMD integrated or discrete GPU machine;
- one machine where `/dev/dri/renderD*` exists but GBM/EGL degrades cleanly;
- one headless or restricted environment where the real smoke is skipped or
  unavailable without failing default validation;
- repeated clean-build runs on the primary development machine.

Each matrix entry must record only reduced evidence: command, pass/fail status,
draw status, presentation status, and whether a child-process crash was
contained. Do not record render-node paths, fd numbers, GBM/EGL handles, driver
error strings, pixels, or KMS object identity.
