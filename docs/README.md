# Sophia Documentation Map

Sophia documentation is divided by purpose. A document's role determines what
wins when prose disagrees.

## Proposed Constitution

- [Specification](specification.md) is the **unratified discussion draft** for
  project invariants, hard non-goals, compatibility admission, and amendment
  rules. It does not override the normative architecture documents yet.

## Normative Architecture

- [Architecture](architecture.md) defines process ownership and the boundaries
  between Engine, protocol authorities, runtime, WM, portals, and chrome.
- [Namespaces and Portals](namespaces-and-portals.md) defines session identity,
  admission, isolation profiles, capabilities, portal lifecycle, and
  cross-namespace failure behavior.
- [Data-Oriented Design](dod.md) defines the packet, snapshot, typed-ID, and
  private-state rules used across those boundaries.
- [Style Guide](style-guide.md) defines source-layout and implementation
  discipline.

Normative documents describe both current and target contracts. They must label
unimplemented target behavior explicitly.
- [Sophia WM API](sophia-wm-api.md) defines the versioned, metadata-blind native
  policy contract shared by Sophia WMs and legacy compatibility profiles.

## Subsystem Contracts And Current Status

- [Sophia X Server Frontend](sophia-x-authority.md) records the native X11
  frontend boundary, implemented surface, and remaining production gaps.
- [Sophia X11 WM Bridge](sophia-x11-wm-bridge.md) records the optional legacy-WM
  policy adapter. It is not an application authority.
- [Renderer Import Boundary](renderer-import-boundary.md), [Live Backend
  Dependency Policy](live-backend-dependency-policy.md), and [Live Session
  Bootstrap](live-session-bootstrap.md) define backend/runtime seams.

Subsystem documents may describe implementation details, but they may not
override the ownership and trust rules in the normative architecture.

## Evidence And Active Work

- [X11 Compatibility Matrix](x11-compatibility-matrix.md) is the admission
  record for native X11 client behavior.
- [Validation](validation.md) lists reproducible validation commands and gates.
- [Active Roadmap](../todo.md) contains current milestone progress, incomplete
  work, and measurable exits.
- [Active Research Log](research-log.md) contains current investigations and
  retained evidence.

## Historical Material

- [Roadmap History](roadmap-history.md) archives completed milestones.
- [Research Log Archive](research-log-archive.md) preserves completed or
  superseded experiments.
- `research/xlibre/` preserves the retired XLibre prototype and its regression
  lessons outside the production workspace.
- `research/wayland/` preserves the retired Wayland frontend, tools, fixtures,
  and final subsystem contract outside the production workspace.

Historical documents are evidence, not current architecture. XLibre bridge
types, XComposite mirror paths, and prototype routed-input extensions must not
be cited as active Sophia interfaces.
